# Pandemic Pulse: A Visual Journey through USA's COVID-19 Data:

## Intro
The Pandemic Pulse project aimed to make sense of the chaos and confusion that enveloped the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It drew from daily updated datasets from the COVID-19 Tracking project and NYTimes to craft a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard using Tableau.

## Dataset
The datasets included meticulous information from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Each daily entry cataloged the number of tests conducted, their results (positive, negative, or pending), and the number of recorded deaths. This wealth of information served as a potent tool in understanding the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States.

## Project Objective
The primary goal was to elucidate the convoluted data and provide a clear, actionable picture of the COVID-19 situation. The Tableau dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to navigate through the data with ease. Key visualizations presented the spread of the virus over time across different states, changes in the number of people tested, and shifts in testing outcomes.

## Follow-up thought
Pandemic Pulse went beyond mere data visualization. It strove to make the information accessible and understandable to the public, policymakers, and healthcare professionals. By elucidating pandemic trends and their socio-economic implications, the project offered vital insights that could aid in crafting effective responses to the health crisis. Within its first month, the dashboard attracted over 1,000 users, highlighting its relevance and effectiveness.
